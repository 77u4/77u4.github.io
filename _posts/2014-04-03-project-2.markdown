I’m a member of The Left and the European Left. Furthermore I’m engaged at linksjugend [‘solid] Karlsruhe. We're running various projects, e.g. "Freifunk hilft", an action alliance by linksjugend ['solid'], Grüne Jugend Karlruhe and [Entropia e.V.](http://entropia.de) (Chaos Computer Club) which aims to equip the refugee reception centers in Karlsruhe with free [Freifunk](http://freifunk.net) WLAN Routers and Network Infrastructure.

I’m photographing concerts, festivals, when traveling and I love portrait-photography. I have uploaded a fine selection of my photos on [500px.com](https://500px.com/jannishutt) and some other, semi-interesting picdump on [Flickr](https://flickr.com/jannishutt).

I'm using a Nikon D3200 camera body and three lenses:

- Nikon 18-55mm f/3,5-5,6G AF-S DX
- Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX
- Nikon 55-200mm f/4-5,6G AF-S DX

I run some programming projects (unfortunately few of them are public) using various programming techniques, from machine-level programming languages such as Assembler and C, scripting languages like PHP to high-level languages like Java.

Here are some of my public projects:

- Caffeine Counter: A watchapp for the [Pebble Smartwatch](http://getpebble.com) which counts your caffeine intake. ([Pebble AppStore](https://apps.getpebble.com/applications/54a6f1fc4517d0f37c0000a8), [Code on GitHub](https://github.com/77u4/caffeinecounter))
- nowplaying: A little website that gets your currently playing song from last.fm and displays it. ([Demo](http://nowplaying.jh0.eu), [Code on GitHub](https://github.com/77u4/nowplaying))
- Sharebase: This former project's aim was to build an easy-to-use multi-user self-hosted sharing platform.
